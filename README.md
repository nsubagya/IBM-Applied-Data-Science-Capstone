# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone project
This repository contains my work for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project. Throughout this project, I have applied the knowledge and skills acquired during the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program to solve a real-world problem using data analysis and machine learning.

## Project Overview
In this capstone project, I have explored and analyzed a specific dataset (briefly describe the dataset) to gain insights, make data-driven decisions, and develop a predictive model to address a particular problem or question. I have used Python, various libraries, and machine learning algorithms to accomplish this project's goals.

## Project Highlights
* Data Preprocessing and Exploration
* Feature Engineering
* Machine Learning Model Development
* Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning
* Data Visualization
* Insights and Recommendations

I hope you find this project interesting and insightful. Please explore the repository to learn more about the problem, methodologies, and results. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
